# I2C examples

Some examples of reading and writing to devics on the tilda-mk6 badge in micropython. Note, some of these examples may leave the chips in a different state to their original and therefore the chips may need to be reset before any other examples are attempted.

## Getting started


initialise an i2c object to use:

```
from machine import I2C
from machine import Pin
i2c = I2C(scl=Pin(41), sda=Pin(42))
```

scan the i2c bus for devices:

```
>>> i2c.scan()                                                                   
[18, 44, 80]                                                                     
```

There should be three devices show, 18 is the QMA7981 accelerometer, 44 is the QMC7983 magnetic sensor and 80 is the A1006 crpto chip (to be replaced?)

## QMA7981

Read the identity byte from register 0x00:

```
>>> i2c.readfrom_mem(18,0,1)
b'\xe7'                                                                          
```

interrupt reading (the values assume the chip has an interrupt asserted, if not the values will be oposite):
```
>>> from machine import Pin
>>> irq = Pin(40, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)
>>> irq.value()
0
```

set interrupt pin to active high:
```
>>> i2c.writeto_mem(18, 0x20, 4);
>>> irq.value();
5
```

set interrupt pin back to active low:
```
>>> i2c.writeto_mem(18, 0x20, b'5')                                              
>>> irq.value()                                                                  
0                                                                                
```

to do a power-on reset...
```
>>> i2c.writeto_mem(18, 0x36, b'\xb6')
```

read the power-state:
>>> bytes = i2c.readfrom_mem(18, 0x11, 1)                                        
>>> print("{}".format(bytes[0]))                                                 

read the data int status:
```
>>> bytes = i2c.readfrom_mem(18, 0x0b, 1)
>>> print("{}".format(bytes[0]))
```

initialse settings to 2G, 1024Hz bandwidth
```
>>> i2c.writeto_mem(18, 0x11, b'\xc0')
>>> i2c.writeto_mem(18, 0xf,  b'\x01')
>>> i2c.writeto_mem(18, 0x10,  b'\x05')
```

do a simple read of the x/y/z acceleration values:

```
>>> i2c.writeto_mem(18, 0x11, b'\xc0')
>>> bytes = i2c.readfrom_mem(18, 1, 6)
>>> x = (bytes[0] >> 2) | (bytes[1] << 6)
>>> y = (bytes[2] >> 2) | (bytes[3] << 6)
>>> z = (bytes[4] >> 2) | (bytes[5] << 6)
>>> print("{} {} {}".format(x, y, z))
```

## QMC7983


Read the chip identification register:
```
>>> i2c.readfrom_mem(44, 0xD, 1)
b'2'                                                                             
```

do a basic initialisation, as per the datasheet

```
>>> i2c.writeto_mem(44, 0xb, '\x0f`)
>>> i2c.writeto_mem(44, 0x9, '\x3d')
```

read all the data registers

```
>>> bytes = i2c.readfrom_mem(44, 0x0, 8)
>>> print("{}".format(bytes))
b'\xd8\x07\x19\n\x8e_\x00\xfe'                                                   
```
